# Expense Manager

Spring Boot + Vaadin expense-management app (V1). Server-side Java (Flow, no
React/Hilla), real Postgres from day one, deployed as a Docker container.

Orientation: `docs/plan.md` (phased build plan), `docs/glossary.md` (domain
language), `docs/adr/` (architecture decisions, see `docs/adr/README.md`),
`docs/findings.md` (friction/gaps log — a first-class deliverable),
`docs/design/` (the design spec — decided values, token scale, component specs;
consult it before comparing a design's values to the app's),
`docs/vaadin-gotchas.md` (Vaadin behaviour no config confesses).

## Theming — Aura, never Lumo

This app uses the **Aura** theme (`@StyleSheet(Aura.STYLESHEET)`), not Lumo.
Aura and Lumo are separate, incompatible design systems.

**Never reference a custom property Aura does not define.** That is the rule; the
`--lumo-*` prefix is only its commonest instance. A `var()` on an undefined property
**with a fallback renders the fallback, permanently** — the CSS works, looks right
today, and never tracks the theme again. Nothing errors, and it surfaces months later
as "some corners are the wrong colour in dark mode" (F-062). Four other ways to hit
exactly the same bug:

- a typo — `var(--vaadin-radius-md, 9px)`; it is `-m`
- a token from a newer Vaadin than the app runs
- a token an upgrade **removed** — the code keeps rendering at the frozen literal
- a project property used before it was defined — `var(--em-card-radius, 12px)`

`--lumo-*` is the instance you will actually meet, because the Figma Aura kit names
its variables that way and emits several dozen per frame, each with a hardcoded
fallback. Translate every one to its `--aura-*` / `--vaadin-*` equivalent.

Without a fallback the property is merely invalid, so it behaves as unset — visible,
and the lesser problem. **`LumoIcon` is not covered by any of this and is fine:** a
supported Vaadin 25.2 icon set, on the classpath via `vaadin-lumo-theme-25.2.1.jar`,
and what the Figma annotations correctly prescribe. It is *defined*, which is the
whole test. Swapping it for `VaadinIcon` on the strength of its name changes the
rendered icon size (F-062).

Style with:

- `--aura-*` for Aura-specific tokens: accent colour (`--aura-accent-color`,
  `--aura-accent-surface`), surfaces (`--aura-surface-color`), typography
  (`--aura-font-size-xs`…`--aura-font-size-xl`), shadows (`--aura-shadow-s/m`),
  palette (`--aura-red`, `--aura-red-text`, …).
- `--vaadin-*` base tokens shared across themes: text (`--vaadin-text-color`,
  `--vaadin-text-color-secondary`), borders (`--vaadin-border-color`,
  `--vaadin-border-color-secondary`), backgrounds (`--vaadin-background-color`,
  `--vaadin-background-container`), spacing (`--vaadin-padding-xs…-xl`,
  `--vaadin-gap-xs…-xl` — **sized only**, there is no bare `--vaadin-padding`/
  `--vaadin-gap` for custom CSS, F-030), radius (`--vaadin-radius-s/m/l`).

Aura has no `Npct` opacity scale (unlike Lumo's `--lumo-*-10pct`); derive
variants with `color-mix(in srgb, var(--aura-red) 15%, transparent)`. Look up
exact token names via the Vaadin docs MCP (`get_theme_css_properties theme=aura`).

For component **theme variants**, use the theme-agnostic `ButtonVariant`
constants — `PRIMARY`, `TERTIARY`, `ERROR`, `SUCCESS`, `WARNING`, `SMALL`,
`LARGE` — **not** the legacy `LUMO_*` ones. The `tertiary-inline`, `contrast`,
and `icon` variants are Lumo-only (no effect under Aura); use plain `TERTIARY`
instead. See findings F-013 and F-017.

A variant Aura does not implement is a *different* mechanism from an undefined
property — it is accepted and ignored rather than frozen at a literal — but it fails
the same way that matters: **silently.** Under Aura none of these errors, so
nothing in a build or a test run tells you the styling you asked for never
happened. That is the property the whole section is guarding against, and it is why
an audit has to check what the theme actually defines rather than grep for a name
(#158).

## Layouts & spacing

**Vaadin layout Java APIs for structure, plain CSS with tokens for the rest.** Never use
`getStyle().set(...)` for anything a layout API covers — spacing/padding go through
`setSpacing("var(--vaadin-gap-m)")` / `setPadding("var(--vaadin-padding-m)")`, flex-grow
through `expand(child)`, scrolling through `Scroller`. Everything the API can't express
(decoration, positioning, truncation, grid, per-element typography/colour) goes into a
scoped, role-named CSS class in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/styles.css` using
`--vaadin-*`/`--aura-*` tokens. Full standard: `docs/theming-layouts.md`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live in GitHub Issues, via the `gh` CLI; external PRs are **not**
a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary — each role's label string equals its name: `needs-triage`,
`needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Design source of truth

The visual design lives in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Irsp3cgi1WX3GiLGpJZECa/Expense-Manager?node-id=88-12278)
— file `Irsp3cgi1WX3GiLGpJZECa`, page `88:12278` ("Visual Design"). `/figma-survey`
resolves a view or component name against that page's frames, so the key belongs here
rather than in an issue body.

`.agent-context` at the repo root records the
four preferences the `figma-to-vaadin` skill resolves — layout approach,
architecture, sample data, verification mode — so a run reads them instead of
asking. Change a value there, not in the skill. `figma-to-vaadin` and
`figma-visual-verification` are project-owned copies of upstream skills, with a
`## Provenance` section at the bottom of each; `figma-survey` and `figma-theme`
are this project's own. All need the project-scoped Figma MCP server, see
`DEVELOPMENT.md`.

**The design spec** lives in `docs/design/` and is the **contract**, not a record of
what was built. One skill writes it, and everything else conforms to it:

- `/figma-survey` **writes the spec.** Scoped `theme`, it reads the design's global
  variables across every mode, puts each divergence to you in one pass, and writes
  `docs/design/foundations/` plus the inputs in `tokens/`. Scoped to a view or a
  component, it writes `docs/design/components/` — one file per component, states
  included. It also produces the **delta** for a ticket. It writes no CSS and no
  Java.
- `/figma-theme` **applies** the global theme: it reads the settled spec, writes only
  what differs from the Aura defaults, proves it in the browser, and writes the
  *resolved values* table back — the one part of the spec only a running app can
  produce. It refuses a spec whose rows are still **open**.
- **Implementation conforms.** Take tokens and states from a component's spec file
  rather than choosing values; a difference is a bug in the code. Never edit a spec
  to match what you just built — that turns the contract into a transcript and hides
  the drift. If a component has no spec, or the design moved, run `/figma-survey`.

Order matters: run the `theme` survey, then `/figma-theme`, before any per-view work.
It decides the font family and base size, which reflow every screen, so spacing
tuned against the old scale is thrown away.
