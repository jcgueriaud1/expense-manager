| Grand-total weight | **800** (Inter Extra Bold, `116:4998`) | 600 | `--aura-font-weight-semibold` = 600 (**−200**) | app | **settled** |

The whole font block was deleted rather than ported: 450/550/650 were tuned for Inter's
variable-weight axis and are meaningless against Instrument Sans. The design's own
weights (500 Medium, 600 Semibold) are exactly the Aura defaults.

**No `@import` is needed.** Aura bundles the Instrument Sans webfont —
`document.fonts` reports `Instrument Sans 400 700 loaded` with no import in the theme
file. Had it not, dropping the Inter import would have silently fallen back to the
system stack.

## The scale

At `--aura-base-font-size: 14`, on Vaadin 25.2.1:

| Token | Size | Line height | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--em-font-size-title` | 40 | — | page headings (off-scale, see below) |
| `--em-font-size-section` | 30 | — | in-page section headings (off-scale, see below) |
| `--em-font-size-detail-title` | 24 | — | a record's own title (off-scale, see below) |
| `--aura-font-size-xl` | 18 | 26 | grand total, list title |
| `--aura-font-size-l` | 16 | 22 | card totals, amounts, detail title, preview amount |
| `--aura-font-size-m` | 14 | 20 | body, card titles, line amounts |
| `--aura-font-size-s` | 13 | 18 | secondary text, line names, callouts, totals rows |
| `--aura-font-size-xs` | 12 | 16 | eyebrows, section labels, technical detail |

Formulas and the derivation trap are in
[`../tokens/token-reference.md`](../tokens/token-reference.md). Two things not to guess:
the ramp is **not** geometric (`xs` is a clamped 0.85 of `m`; `s` is the *midpoint* of
`m` and `xs`), and **Aura's docs are wrong** — they give `xs` as 11px where the app
gives 12px (F-068).

## Text roles

Utility classes in `styles.css`, so a role is named once rather than restated per view:

| Class | Renders |
|---|---|
| `.muted` | secondary colour, `font-size-s` |
| `.muted-xs` | secondary colour, `font-size-xs` |
| `.section-label` | uppercase, `0.05em` tracking, `font-size-xs`, semibold, secondary colour |

## Off-scale

| Design value | Where | Nearest | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 40px | page heading (`156:5404`) | `xl` 18 — top of the scale | `--em-font-size-title: 40px` |
| 30px | section heading (`156:5737`) | `xl` 18 — top of the scale | `--em-font-size-section: 30px` |
| 15px | expense row titles, amounts (16 nodes) | `m` 14 / `l` 16 | accept `l` = 16px (**+1px**) |
| 15px | expense row titles **and** amounts, report detail (12 more nodes) | `m` 14 / `l` 16 | as above — `l` = 16px. The row's name and its amount land on the *same* token, which the app currently splits across 13 and 14 |
| 24px | report-detail title (`241:10552`) | `xl` 18 — top of the scale | `--em-font-size-detail-title: 24px` |
| 20px | report card totals (4 nodes, one per card) | `xl` 18 — top of the scale | `--em-font-size-total: 20px` |
| 28px | metric figures (3 nodes, and 3 more on Approvals) | `xl` 18 — top of the scale | `--em-font-size-metric: 28px` |

Neither 40 nor 30 has an Aura token anywhere near it, and both appear on every reference
page, so each gets a property. 15px is one pixel from a token, and a project property that
shadows the type scale for one pixel is where per-view drift starts.

## Two heading sizes, one token

The design draws its page heading at **24px** on the report-list frame (`116:2499`) and at
**40px** on the reference-table frames (`156:5404`). Same role, same token, two values —
the design contradicts itself across frames, and nothing in either frame says which is
current.

**Decided: 40px, and the 30px section step alongside it.** Taken deliberately over the
cheaper option of keeping 24 and reporting the drift.

**This is a foundation change, not a view's**, because the property is shared: it is
recorded here rather than inside a view's spec so that every consumer moves in one place.
Two consumers move by 16px:

| Consumer | Was | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `report-card` title ([`../components/report-card.md`](../components/report-card.md)) | 24 | 40 |
| app shell's small-screen greeting ([`../components/app-shell.md`](../components/app-shell.md)) | 24 | 40 |

**The consumer list above was one row longer, and that row was wrong.** It claimed "every
view's page heading" as a consumer, citing a line that is in fact the shell's small-screen
greeting — the row below it. When #169 made the change and looked, **no view's page heading
was on this property at all**: the report list's is `.reports-title` at
`--aura-font-size-xl` (18), and Approvals, Review history and Users render an unstyled
`<h2>` at Aura's own default. So the reflow moved exactly two things, both card titles, and
the property only became a page-heading token when this issue's own `.page-title` class
started using it.

That correction makes the consequence **worse**, not better, and it is worth seeing before
the report-list issue takes its decision: the report card and approval card titles now
render at 40px directly beneath an 18px page heading, so the card titles are more than
twice the size of the heading above them. Both views are visibly hierarchy-inverted today.
It is still not this issue's call to fix — see the note below — but it is no longer the
mild "grows with the page heading" the table implied.

A **report card title is not a page heading** and almost certainly should not follow this
token to 40px — it shares `--em-font-size-title` today only because both happened to be
24. Splitting them is a real decision and it belongs to the report-list issue, not to this
survey; until it is taken, that card's title grows with the page heading. The app shell's
50px greeting also now sits only 10px above the page heading it was drawn to tower over.
Both go back to the designer with the frames.

### A record title is not a page heading

The report-detail frame (`116:4444`) draws its title at **24px**, where the reference
frames draw a page heading at 40 and `--em-font-size-title` was re-decided to 40 for that
role. Third frame, third value for what could be read as one role — so this needed
deciding rather than defaulting either way.

**It is a different role, and the frame's geometry proves it.** The `Title Text` node is
769×34 holding a 44-character title: one line at 24px with a 1.4 line height. At 40px the
same string wraps to two lines in the 900px column and three in a narrower one. The design
laid it out as a single line of *record data* — the report's name beside its status pill —
not as a static view name.

That is the argument this file already accepted for `report-card`: "a report card title is
not a page heading and almost certainly should not follow this token to 40px". Applying it
here is consistent with that, not a new exception.

**It takes a property rather than the nearest token.** `xl` 18 is 6px away and is the top
of the text scale, so there is nothing to round to; and 24 is the display ramp's middle
step, which had no property until now. It is named for its role rather than its size
(`--em-font-size-detail-title`, not `--em-font-size-heading`) so that it cannot quietly
become a general-purpose 24 — which is how `--em-font-size-title` came to be shared by a
page heading and two card titles in the first place.

**It does not resolve `report-card`.** That title is still on `--em-font-size-title` at
40px and still hierarchy-inverted, and it may well want this same 24px value. Deciding
that is the report-list issue's, exactly as this file already says; borrowing the new
property pre-emptively would repeat the mistake it was minted to avoid.

### The display ramp

20/24/28 form a coherent 4px ramp **above** the text scale, and all three are what the
design uses for its loudest type: a card's total, a page or card heading, a metric
figure. Aura's scale stops at `xl` 18, so none of the three can be derived — 20 is 2px
past the top and 28 is 10px past it.

Both new values took a property rather than the nearest token, which is a deliberate
exception to the "within a pixel or two takes the token" rule that settled 15px:

- **28px** is nowhere near a token, recurs on every metric, and the Approvals frame
  (`327:11681`) reuses the same card — so the alternative is two views inventing 28px
  separately.
- **20px** is only 2px past `xl`, but it is the report card's total sitting directly
  under a 24px title. Flattening it to 18px compresses a deliberate 24/20 pairing into
  24/18 and makes the money read as secondary to the title, which inverts what the card
  is for.

Whether this ramp should be three project properties or three real tokens in the
design's own scale is the designer's call, and is raised as a question rather than
assumed — see the survey follow-up issue.

### Weight 700 has no Aura token

The frame draws its metric figures, card titles and totals in Public Sans **Bold**
(700). Aura's weight scale stops at `--aura-font-weight-semibold` (600) and defines no
bold. 600 is used and the missing 100 accepted, consistent with the settled row above
recording that the design's *specified* weights (500/600) are exactly the Aura
defaults — the 700 comes from the drawn text, not from a variable, and the drawn text on
this frame is already known to be unreliable (see the defect below).

## Known design defect

Frame `116:4444` declares `Instrument Sans` and renders **three** families — Instrument
Sans (11 nodes), Inter (44), Public Sans (10). The app follows the *variable*, not the
drawn text (ADR-0025 decision 4): a literal reading would have kept Inter, the very value
the design was replacing. The stray families are the designer's to fix (F-069).

Confirmed on a **second** frame: `116:2499` "My Expenses" (the report list) draws Public
Sans across its metric cards, report cards and section headers, and Inter on one section
header — the same defect with the same resolution. Two frames now, so it is systematic
rather than a slip on one screen.
