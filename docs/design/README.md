# Design spec

The visual **specification** for this app: the decisions already taken, so a later
session looks them up instead of taking them again. Its job is to stop drift — an agent
with no memory of the last session will otherwise invent a plausible value
(`padding: 12px`) rather than reach for the settled one, and by the fifth view the app
reads as several products.

The spec holds **opinion and precedent**, not capability. Anything an agent can read out
of the source — a component's constructor, which CSS classes exist — does not belong
here. What belongs here is what the source cannot tell you: *which* blue, *why* this
radius, and which differences from the design were decided deliberately.

**Design source of truth:** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Irsp3cgi1WX3GiLGpJZECa/Expense-Manager?node-id=88-12278)
file `Irsp3cgi1WX3GiLGpJZECa`, page `88:12278`. When the design wins and when it does not
is [ADR-0025](../adr/0025-figma-design-source-of-truth.md); this folder holds the values
that rule produced.

## Layout

```

Patterns — which Java layout API, which CSS, what is forbidden — stay in
[`../theming-layouts.md`](../theming-layouts.md).

## How it is consumed

This folder is the **contract**. One skill writes it; everything else conforms.

- **`/figma-survey` writes it.** Scoped `theme` it writes `foundations/` and the inputs
  in `tokens/`; scoped to a view or component it writes `components/`. It decides each
  divergence with the user rather than transcribing the design, because the calls that
  matter — which side wins, what to do with an off-scale value — are not in the design.
- **`/figma-theme` applies the theme** and owns one table: the *resolved values* in
  `tokens/token-reference.md`, which only a running app can produce. It refuses a spec
  whose rows are still **open**.
- **Implementation conforms.** Read `tokens/token-reference.md` and the component's file;
  take the tokens and states from there. A difference is a bug in the code. **Never edit a
  spec file to match what was just built** — re-run the survey instead.
- **`/figma-visual-verification` fills the measured figures** a survey cannot: contrast
  ratios and rendered sizes need a running app, so a survey leaves those slots marked
  unverified.

## Status vocabulary

Every decision row carries one:

- **settled** — decided, whichever side won. A later run names it settled and moves on.
  A divergence resolved in the *app's* favour is settled, not absent: that row is the
  whole point, because it stops the next survey reporting the app's own font as a
  mismatch.
- **open** — deferred. A survey may raise it again, and should.

## What is still open

| Area | Owner |
|---|---|
| App shell — top header bar, gradient, nav widths (220/250), page inset (80px) | #146 |
| Per-view spacing against the new token scale | one issue per view |
| Report card hover — invisible on actionable cards; the design draws no hover state | the report-list redesign |
| `--em-font-size-total` / `--em-font-size-metric` decided but not yet in `aura-theme.css` | whoever applies the theme next |
| Whether `report-card`'s title should follow `--em-font-size-title` to 40px, or split off its own property | the report-list issue |
| Which reference route the Reference Tables pill points at when a user can reach only some of the three — it is `/vat-rates` unconditionally, and all three are ADMIN-only, so the case cannot occur yet | the shell issue |
| Row actions behind a `⋮` menu on `VatRateView` / `ExpenseTypeView`, where reorder is boundary-disabled | the reference-view issues |
| Whether the 20/24/28 display ramp should be design tokens rather than `--em-*` properties | the designer |

## Lifecycle

`foundations/` and `tokens/` are **data**, refreshed when the theme changes or the Vaadin
version moves. The *rationale* is prose and lives in an ADR, which is immutable — a
deliberate split, because an immutable document holding mutable data goes stale silently
and a survey reading it would trust stale numbers.

`components/` is append-and-amend: each per-view issue updates what it touches.
