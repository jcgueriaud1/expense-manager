# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records one load-bearing decision for the Expense Management app (V1), the context that forced it, and its consequences. ADRs are immutable once accepted — to change a decision, add a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

Status values: `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`, `Deprecated`.
